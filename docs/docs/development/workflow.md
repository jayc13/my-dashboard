# Development Workflow

This guide outlines the complete development workflow for My Dashboard, from planning to deployment.

## üåø Branch Naming

### Branch Naming Conventions

We follow a structured branch naming convention to maintain clarity and organization:

```
<type>/<scope>/<description>
```

**Types:**
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without functional changes
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

**Scope (optional):**
- `api/` - Backend API changes
- `ui/` - Frontend UI changes
- `db/` - Database-related changes
- `ci/` - CI/CD pipeline changes
- `config/` - Configuration changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feature/api/user-authentication
bugfix/ui/dashboard-loading-spinner
hotfix/api/security-vulnerability
chore/deps/update-react-version
docs/api/endpoint-documentation
refactor/ui/component-structure
test/api/integration-tests
```

### Branch Creation

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/api/new-endpoint

# Push the branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/api/new-endpoint
```

## üîÑ Development Process

### 1. Planning Phase

**Create GitHub Issue:**
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of the feature/bug

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Technical Notes
- Implementation details
- Dependencies
- Considerations
```

**Assign and Label:**
- Assign the issue to yourself
- Add appropriate labels (feature, bug, enhancement, etc.)
- Set milestone if applicable

### 2. Development Phase

**Branch Creation:**
```bash
# Always start from the latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Development Cycle:**
1. **Write Code** - Implement the feature/fix
2. **Write Tests** - Add comprehensive tests
3. **Run Tests** - Ensure all tests pass
4. **Commit Changes** - Use conventional commits
5. **Push Regularly** - Push work-in-progress commits

**Commit Frequently:**
```bash
# Make small, focused commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add user authentication endpoint"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Testing Phase

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Run linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

**Manual Testing:**
- Test the feature in the browser
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify responsive design (if UI changes)
- Test API endpoints with different inputs

### 4. Review Phase

**Pre-PR Checklist:**
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] Edge cases are handled

**Create Pull Request:**
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots (if applicable)
Add screenshots for UI changes

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests added/updated
```

### 5. Code Review Process

**For Reviewers:**
- Review code for logic, style, and best practices
- Test the changes locally if needed
- Provide constructive feedback
- Approve when satisfied

**For Authors:**
- Address all feedback promptly
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Make requested changes
- Re-request review after changes

### 6. Integration Phase

**Before Merge:**
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] At least one approval from code owner
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main

**Merge Strategies:**
- **Squash and Merge** - For feature branches (default)
- **Merge Commit** - For release branches
- **Rebase and Merge** - For small, clean commits

**After Merge:**
```bash
# Clean up local branches
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git remote prune origin
```

## üöÄ Release Process

### Version Management

We use semantic versioning (SemVer):
- **MAJOR** - Breaking changes
- **MINOR** - New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** - Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Workflow

1. **Create Release Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
   ```

2. **Update Version:**
   ```bash
   # Update package.json versions
   npm version minor
   ```

3. **Create Release PR:**
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update documentation
   - Final testing

4. **Deploy and Tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

## üîß Git Hooks

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Lint Staged Files** - ESLint and Prettier
- **Type Check** - TypeScript compilation
- **Test Changed Files** - Run relevant tests

### Pre-push Hooks
- **Full Test Suite** - Run all tests
- **Build Check** - Ensure project builds successfully

### Commit Message Validation
- **Commitlint** - Enforce conventional commit format
- **Length Limits** - Subject line ‚â§ 50 characters

## üêõ Hotfix Process

For critical production issues:

1. **Create Hotfix Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix
   ```

2. **Implement Fix:**
   - Minimal changes to fix the issue
   - Add tests to prevent regression
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Fast-track Review:**
   - Create PR with "HOTFIX" label
   - Get expedited review from team lead
   - Deploy immediately after approval

4. **Backport if Needed:**
   - Cherry-pick to release branches
   - Update version numbers appropriately

## üìä Workflow Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Lead Time** - Time from issue creation to deployment
- **Cycle Time** - Time from first commit to deployment
- **Review Time** - Time from PR creation to approval
- **Deployment Frequency** - How often we deploy
- **Change Failure Rate** - Percentage of deployments causing issues

### Continuous Improvement
- Weekly retrospectives
- Process refinement based on metrics
- Tool and automation improvements
- Team feedback incorporation

This workflow ensures high code quality, efficient collaboration, and reliable deployments while maintaining development velocity.
