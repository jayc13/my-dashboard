  description: |
    Retrieve JIRA issues assigned to the current authenticated user that are unresolved.
    This endpoint returns tickets ordered by last updated date (most recent first).
    
    **Predefined JQL Query:**
    ```
    assignee = currentUser() AND resolution = Unresolved order by updated DESC
    ```
    
    This endpoint is useful for:
    - Personal dashboards showing assigned work
    - Task management and prioritization
    - Daily standup preparation
    - Workload tracking
    
    **Note:** The "current user" is determined by the JIRA API credentials configured on the server.
